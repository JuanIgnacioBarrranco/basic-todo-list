# basic-todo-list
I choose to write everything in English to make it more professional:


  Simple Repository for basic static todo list made by Juan Ignacio Barranco for "Ensolvers" interview given task



  I have coded a simple todo app using HTML5, with BOOTSTRAP for the styling, and using JavaScript with Jquery for behaviour. 

  
  Then I deployed it with Vercel Cli 22.0.1
